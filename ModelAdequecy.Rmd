# What to check for

To do a full check of model adequacy these are what seems to be necessary

1. *Linearity*
2. *Independent Residuals*
3. *No Separation*
4. *No Overdispersion*
5. *No Multicollinearity*

These are the necessary checks in linear regression

1. *Normal Residuals*
2. *Independent Residuals*
3. *Linearity*
4. *No Influential Points*
6. *No Multicollinearity*
